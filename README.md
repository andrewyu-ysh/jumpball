Picture this: in an NBA arena, a Tony Allen-type is all pumped up, gesturing the home crowd to stand up and cheer. Players on the other team are only slightly annoyed, some arguing with the refs. The PA system starts playing that song you've heard of, but don't know why ([Kriss Kross - Jump](https://youtu.be/010KyIQjkTk)). A jump ball is about to occur in the game.

# jumpball: Are Jump Balls in the NBA Officiated Properly?

## TL;DR
* __Hypothesis__: in the majority of jump balls, the basketball is tipped before it reaches its maximum height.
* __Verdict__: ____

## 1. Introduction

Despite the iconic nature of the tip-off, jump balls are rare in NBA basketball. They also don't seem to be all that valuable, especially the tip-off, since both teams get the ball to start a quarter twice regardless of who wins it. So it's not surprising that not many people seem to care about the jump ball, except when the home team forces a jump ball. To me, it's more of a display of effort and engagement, like how an athletic block or a thunderous dunk seem to mean more than they do on paper.

I've also started to suspect that the refs don't care that much either. Sometimes they nudge players to their respective spots before the jump ball if they are positioned too aggressively, but how often do you see violations being called on jump balls? I hypothesize that there are frequent uncalled violations in NBA jump balls, especially the one in which the basketball is tipped before it reaches its maximum height.

## 2. Official NBA Rules

NBA's rules on the jump ball are described in Rule No. 6, Sections V, VI, and VII as follows:

> __Section V — Jump Balls in Center Circle__
> 
> a. The ball shall be put into play in the center circle by a jump ball between any two
> opponents:
> 
>   1. At the start of the game
>   2. At the start of each overtime period
>   3. A double free throw violation
>   4. Double foul during a loose ball situation
>   5. The ball becomes dead when neither team is in control and no field goal or infraction is involved
>   6. The ball comes to rest on the basket flange or becomes lodged between the basket ring and the backboard
>   7. A double foul which occurs as a result of a difference in opinion between officials
>   8. A suspension of play occurs during a loose ball
>   9. A fighting foul occurs during a loose ball situation
>   10. The officials are in doubt as to which team hit the ball out of bounds and the players cannot be identified
> 
> b. In all cases above, the jump ball shall be between any two opponents in the game at that time. If injury, ejection or disqualification makes it necessary for any player to be replaced, his substitute may not participate in the jump ball.
> 
> __Section VI — Other Jump Balls__
> 
> a. The ball shall be put into play by a jump ball at the circle which is closest to the spot where:
> 
>   1. A held ball occurs
>   2. A ball out-of-bounds caused by both teams
>   3. An official is in doubt as to who last touched the ball
>   
> b. The jump ball shall be between the two involved players unless injury or ejection precludes one of the jumpers from participation. If the injured player must leave the game or is ejected, the coach of the opposing team shall select from his opponent’s bench a player who will replace the injured or ejected player. The injured player will not be permitted to re-enter the game.
> 
> __Section VII — Restrictions Governing Jump Balls__
> 
> a. Each jumper must have at least one foot on or inside that half of the jumping circle which is farthest from his own basket. Each jumper must have both feet within the restraining circle.
> 
> b. The ball must be tapped by one or both of the players participating in the jump ball after it reaches its highest point. If the ball falls to the floor without being tapped by at least one of the jumpers, one of the officials off the ball shall whistle the ball dead and signal another toss.
> 
> c. Neither jumper may tap the tossed ball before it reaches its highest point.
> 
> d. Neither jumper may leave his half of the jumping circle until the ball has been tapped.
> 
> e. Neither jumper may catch the tossed or tapped ball until it touches one of the eight non-jumpers, the floor, the basket or the backboard.
> 
> f. Neither jumper is permitted to tap the ball more than twice on any jump ball.
> 
> g. The eight non-jumpers will remain outside the restraining circle until the ball has been tapped. Teammates may not occupy adjacent positions around the restraining circle if an opponent desires one of the positions. No player may position himself immediately behind an opponent on the restraining circle.
> 
> Penalty for c., d., e., f., g.: Ball awarded out-of-bounds to the opponent.
> 
> h. Player position on the restraining circle is determined by the direction of a player’s basket. The player whose basket is nearest shall have first choice of position, with positions being alternated thereafter.

That is a lot of rules and I don't expect the refs to catch all of these violations in a jump ball.
